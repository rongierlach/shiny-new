## A work in progress...  
A shiny new build system using React, Babel, Webpack, Express, Horizon, and RethinkDB  
Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/flipace/lovli.js">lovli.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Art404/boiler404">boiler404</a>, and <a href="http://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html">this blog post by Marmelab</a>  :sparkles:  

## Todos  
- [x] decide on general directory and config organization
- [x] write express server and create static routes
- [ ] finish the webpack client configs
- [ ] finish the webpack server config
- [ ] write react middleware for isomorphic rendering in `./server/middleware`
